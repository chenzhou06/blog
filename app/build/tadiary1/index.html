                    <h2>As a Teaching Assistant</h2>
<p>TA, abbreviation of Teaching Assistant, is responsible for checking assignments
submitted from undergraduates in our school.</p>
<p>As soon as I arrived the document office where I often spend most of my day, I received
some text messages from <em>comrade of the studies</em>. The day I as a TA started.</p>
<h2>Giving Score</h2>
<p>After some assignments, criteria about how to score their work emerged gradually.</p>
<ol>
<li>If their answers are complete, they get an <code>A</code> at least.</li>
<li>If there are absence of small parts in their answers, they may get a <code>B</code> <code>B+</code> or <code>B-</code>
according to degrees of the missing parts.</li>
<li>If there answers can hardly cover the standard answers in a half, their score will
be under <code>B</code>.</li>
<li>Good handwriting can add a <code>+</code> to the base score.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Problems of Their Work</h2>
<p>There are some problems I want to point out when I have a chance to give them a lecture.</p>
<ul>
<li>Answer the questions as you have contemplated them seriously. Don't just put some key
words under the question. Some explanations are essential.</li>
<li>Readability is very important. Don't squeeze your answer into a small space of paper. Express your ideas in a organized way, and organize your ideas not just in
your mind but also in the appearance of your writing. Using indentation, itemization
to get your words more friendly to readers.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Thinking on the Questions</h2>
<h3>What is the object of Economics research?</h3>
<p>There is a paragraph in the textbook mentioned that question. It says Economics studies
distribution of resources. However, I think the scope of economic research has
extended beyond that. Nowadays, Economist do not limit their interests in business
or economy. They have entered the domain which had been thought as sociologist or psychologist's expertise. Economic Imperialism which led by Gary Becker has made
Economics a more special way to observing the world, a way that treats people as rational man. A more proper interpretation of the goal of Economics is that Economics
studies how people choose.</p>
<h3>Which is more efficient, plan, market, or mix?</h3>
<p>There three main ways to function the whole economy, by making plan, by market, or both. The textbook says the mix mode is prevailing among countries. Governments
around the world all take an important part of the operation of the market. The
answer is clear, mix mode is the most efficient way. But why? It needs a lot of
ponder upon this question.</p>
