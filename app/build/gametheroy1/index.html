                    <p>Formal courses started this week. At Friday afternoon I took my first Game Theory
Lecture which taught by professor Gong who had given Econometrics lessons to me. He
 and me are both from the same place, Changde, Hunan.</p>
<p>Pr. Gong has strong accent. When he read hog lot in Chinese, he pronounced the word
incorrectly, which amused us a lot.</p>
<h1>Game Theory and mainstream Economics</h1>
<p>Game Theory dismissed the <em>Perfect Information</em> hypothesis, and any hypotheses
without micro-foundation. However, Game Theory persisted\retained\reserved the
hypothesis of <em>Rational Man</em>. Game Theory also has a stronger emphasis on interactions
between entities in economic activities.</p>
<p>Although both studying human behavior, Economics and Psychology are different.
Economics assumed people are homogeneous. The entities in this world are focus
on their own interests. Their intentions are to maximum their utility. Psychology
researches people's mind, explains people's behavior by exploring their mental
activities.</p>
<h1>Basic Ideas</h1>
<ul>
<li>Players, who pursue maximization of utility.</li>
<li>Actions</li>
<li>Strategy</li>
<li>Information</li>
<li>Pay-offs Function</li>
<li>...</li>
</ul>
<h1>Funny Thinking</h1>
<p>There is a game that two people walk against each other on a single-plank bridge.
In this game, there are two <em>Nash Equilibrium</em>, one holding back and another feeling great because he\she is more brave.</p>
<p>This game is vary similar to a close relationship. In this 'love game', we fight
for dominant position to force the other to accept our own thoughts and lifestyle,
just as walking towards each other with fists waved.</p>
<p>If none of us compromised, the relationship may go to a dead end. Both person's
utility will decrease a lot. So the outcome of the game must be that one compromise and another takes dominant position between them, as long as they behave
rationally.</p>
<p>From this reasoning, we can infer that the one who takes the dominant position invests
less in this relationship than the other, otherwise he\she acts irrationally.</p>
