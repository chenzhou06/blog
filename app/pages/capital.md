## Is capital's power over labor's?

From Marx's view, `Political structure` is depended on `business foundation`.


## What is capital's power?

Why we say that capital can **?take commands of human?**. Capital hires labor to
produce products. Labor takes order from owners of capital. Who owns capital can
impact other's behavior. Capitalist's power is derived from their capital. They
invent their capital to establish productive infrastructure. Labor's life is highly
connected to the compensation they received from capitalist. Capital can not decide
what to produce, how to produce, for whom they produce, capital's power is limited
to the scope where recognizable interaction happens. Because the owner's power roots
in capital, in this context we take capital as same as the owner.

## Why capital can control labor?

We input two factors to produce products, why all the revenue go to capital first
then distribute to labor by capital.

### The relative importance between capital and labor in production is different?

Capital is more essential to production? Without capital the production can not
happen. Before the first production is produced, there are many procedure must be
gone through. It demand much more time to decide which project is profitable. Because
capitalist has invent many wealth in a project. They must select best men to operate
this business. Who is more tied to the business, who is in command.

But why the employee still needs to listen to their boss after the infrastructure
is completed.
